H_0 Tension: Demonstration of Measures and Tensions

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the tension in determining the Hubble constant, H_0, using the main available measurements.
Description

The Hubble constant, H_0, is a fundamental measure of the rate of expansion of the universe. However, different measurement methods have produced discrepant values, leading to a "tension" between these measures. This notebook explores this tension by visualizing the results of the main H_0 measurements and comparing them.
Content

    Jupyter Notebook: The H0_Tension.ipynb file contains the Python code to load the H_0 measurements data, create graphs, and perform comparative analyses.

Requirements
Pandas
Matplotlib

Graphs

The notebook includes two main graphs:

    Graph 1 - H_0 Measurements: This graph shows the different H_0 measurements and their uncertainties, including measurements based on cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), type Ia supernovae (SN), gravitational lensing (GL), among others.

    Graph 2 - H_0 Tension: This graph visualizes the tension between the different H_0 measurements, highlighting the discrepancy between them and its implication in understanding fundamental physics.
